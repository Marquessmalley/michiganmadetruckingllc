        Michigan Made trucking LLC was created by myself after being a driver
        for many years for other companies and still felt as if I wasnâ€™t where I
        should be financially. My dream was to own and run an independent
        successful trucking company and pay the people that do most of the work
        (the drivers) a wage that makes sense. and treat our customers and our
        employees with respect and honesty. As a driver myself I know that
        communication is key to any successful relationship. And if you want an
        experienced, down to earth, hardworking, honest partner in this
        dog-eat-dog world of trucking, give me a call.
